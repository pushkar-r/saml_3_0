Summary:

 SAML 2.0 has established itself as a cornerstone for federated identity management, enabling secure communication between Identity Providers (IdPs) and Service Providers (SPs). While the protocol supports robust authentication and assertion mechanisms, it ties signing certificates directly to SP configurations, requiring manual interventions for certificate rotations.
 This tight coupling creates significant operational inefficiencies during certificate expiration or renewal processes. Organizations often face service disruptions, misconfigurations, and delays due to the manual synchronization required by both IdP and SP administrators.
 To address these challenges, we propose a Certificate Abstraction Layer (CAL), a mechanism to decouple certificate management from the SAML authentication workflow. CAL introduces a dynamic certificateID association model, enabling SPs to reference certificates indirectly via base64-encoded thumbprints. A centralized certificate metadata endpoint hosted by IdPs will facilitate automated discovery and validation. This also include caching mechanisms on SPs for certificate metadata and extensibility of federation metadata for seamless CAL integration.
 The proposed enhancement reduces human oversight, improves scalability, and fosters automation-friendly workflows. CAL offers backward compatibility, allowing organizations to migrate gradually without disrupting legacy federation setups.
